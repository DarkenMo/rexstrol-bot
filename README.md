# how to use the bot on docker:
- i have provided the docker file and the dockerignorefile in the source.
- you gotta know how to use docker.
- you just keep the files in your code.
- do `docker build -t username/projectname:1.0` in your terminal to build your project.
- after doing the previous step a docker image must be created in your docker desktop app.
- run the image and turn it into a container and boom now your discord bot is on docker.

this was written when i had the basic knowledge of docker

enjoy!
